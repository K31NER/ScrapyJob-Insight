Notion helps you build beautiful tools for your life’s work. In today's world of endless apps and tabs, Notion provides one place for teams to get everything done, seamlessly connecting docs, notes, projects, calendar, and email—with AI built in to find answers and automate work. Millions of users, from individuals to large organizations like Toyota, Figma, and OpenAI, love Notion for its flexibility and choose it because it helps them save time and money.
In-person collaboration is essential to Notion's culture. We require all team members to work from our offices on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, our designated Anchor Days. Certain teams or positions may require additional in-office workdays.
About The Team
Notion’s flexibility comes from a small set of powerful
primitives
—our core software building blocks that can be composed into many different products.
By Primitives And Building Blocks, We Mean Things Like
Databases and views that represent data and UI, and power use cases from project management and CRMs to posts feeds and reporting.
Pages, comments, reactions, permissions, and teamspaces that define how information is structured, shared, and discussed.
The underlying product and technical systems that let these primitives be reused, extended, and packaged into solutions for different customers.
The
Primitive Foundations
team exists to make these building blocks more robust, reusable, and understandable across Notion. We:
Help decompose new product ideas and use-cases into the right primitive solutions.
Build and evolve those primitives so they work well across many product surfaces.
Partner closely with other product teams, designers, and product managers to turn primitives into complete products that customers love.
About The Role
As a Software Engineer on Primitive Foundations, you will work across the stack to design, build, and evolve Notion’s core building blocks. Your work will directly shape how teams use Notion to create their own tools—for docs and wikis, issue tracking, project management, CRMs, dashboards, and more.
Your work may include both internal platform contributions to accelerate other Notion engineering teams, and end-user facing products to enable toolmaking ubiquity. The team acts as a multiplier for the engineering organization and helps evolve the product.
What You'll Achieve
Shape Notion’s primitives: Work on the foundational pieces of Notion’s building blocks—such as databases, views, and layout systems—so they can support more complex and demanding workflows over time.
Turn use cases into systems: Partner with other product teams to decompose user problems into primitive-level improvements, and design solutions that can be reused across many product areas.
Ship impactful, user-facing products: Build polished, high-quality experiences in TypeScript and React that are used by millions of people, and iterate based on feedback and data.
Multiply other teams: Create documentation, patterns, and APIs that make it easier for other teams at Notion to understand, extend, and compose primitives correctly.
Improve reliability and performance: Identify and deliver technical investments that make our primitive systems more robust, observable, and performant as Notion scales.
Skills You'll Need To Bring
3+ years of professional experience (or equivalent): You’ve shipped meaningful product features to tens of thousands of users, and have taken multiple complex projects from design through launch. We’re open to less tenure for exceptional candidates with strong signal.
Full-stack product engineering experience: You are comfortable working in TypeScript and React on the frontend, and in Node.js or similar environments on the backend. You care about data modeling, API design, and how things are built end‑to‑end.
Strong UI and UX sensibilities: You like spending time in the product, thinking about interaction details, and collaborating closely with designers and PMs to produce high-quality user experiences.
Systems thinking: You naturally look for abstractions and patterns. You enjoy understanding how product and technical systems fit together, and you design solutions that scale across many use cases—not just the one immediately in front of you.
Excellent collaboration and communication: You work well with engineers, PMs, designers, and GTM partners. You can explain complex technical ideas in clear language, and you engage thoughtfully with different perspectives.
Deep familiarity with Notion: You’ve used Notion regularly for 1+ year, and you are a power user who understands its strengths, limitations, and pain points. You’ve built your own systems (databases, views, dashboards, or templates) and have ideas on how the primitives could be better.
What We’d Love To See
High agency and ownership: You’re comfortable working through ambiguity, proactively identifying what needs to be done, and driving projects forward. Side projects, open source, or examples of self-directed work are a plus.
Experience with tools for thought or adjacent products: You have experience building flexible, composable tools that let users create their own productivity workflows.
Talking to users: You’re comfortable (and energized by) talking directly to customers or internal stakeholders, and using that feedback to shape your work.
Breadth of interests: You have interests beyond pure engineering—such as design, writing, education, or other creative fields—and you bring that perspective into how you think about product and systems.
We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply.

About The Role
Millions of people use Notion — and this number is increasing every day. That means millions of people trust us to deliver a fast, reliable, and secure experience, and we value this more than anything. We want to keep earning trust, while also continuing to amaze our users with the tools they can build in Notion.

We are looking for engineers who are passionate about solving engineering productivity challenges, have deep empathy for other developers, and love to communicate with engineers. You don't need to have experience in this domain but willing to advocate for developer experience is the key.
What You'll Achieve
Collaborate with engineers across the company to deliver an industry-leading developer experience, along the way working deeply with tools like the TypeScript language server, lint tooling, and the Notion CLI to improve developers’ day to day experience.
Work on the bleeding edge of tooling performance, researching and evaluating new tools and keeping up with new developments in the developer experience space in the JS ecosystem.
Work deeply with GitHub and our CI systems to help ensure engineers can merge their code quickly and safely. We aim for all PR CI pipelines to finish within 15 minutes!

Skills You'll Need To Bring
A drive to make developers’ lives better: you have a strong interest in keeping engineers in their flow state through better tooling. You like to think critically about the workflows engineers use in their day to day work, finding bottlenecks and thinking outside of the box to find ways to pave a better golden path for engineers to follow.
A focus on user experience: you bring care and craft to the user experience you build into your products. Your work emphasizes simplicity, supportability, and ease-of-use, and you communicate clearly with other teams and engineers to get feedback on where we can improve.
Multitasker and present: you like interrupts especially if this is blocking engineers.You switch between your project work and day to day developer experience challenges.
Interest in learning how things work: you love to learn how the tools you use work at a fundamental level. You get excited at the idea of digging into third-party source code to understand how they work and find new ways to use them.
Pragmatic and business-oriented: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You don't just go after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.
Nice To Haves
Familiarity with TypeScript, especially in ways to keep it running smoothly in a large codebase.
An interest in automated testing and familiarity with testing best practices
Past experience with React and common tooling like React Testing Library
Past experience on developer experience teams or related tools

Rilla builds the world’s leading conversation intelligence software for offline commerce.
By recording, analyzing, and indexing conversations, our platform supplies unparalleled alpha to the critical, physical businesses that constitute the backbone of our economy.
Our purpose is to bring the technology of the 21st century’s most innovative companies to the rest of the economy.
As a side effect of this mission, we’ve become one of the fastest growing companies in history. In numbers, that means 0→$40M in 3.5 years, growing 15% MoM, Net Revenue Retention above 170%, an NPS higher than the iPhone’s, and profitability.
The Role
Rilla engineers architect and ship features across the stack at lightning speed. On a daily basis, you will build end-to-end workflows, take them to production, and solve real world problems across an out-sized scale.
As an early technical steward, you will raise the bar for code quality and decision‑making, setting patterns that cement a world‑class engineering culture as we scale. While the company 10×’s, your scope and ownership will grow just as fast—building the tools, mental models, and platforms that let both you and Rilla accelerate exponentially.
Do you describe yourself as ""obsessive""? Do you aspire to be a founder or a leader in applying AI to the physical world? We believe Rilla is the best place — with the best peers — to learn how.
Technologies We Use
Different languages and frameworks, including React, React Native, Typescript and Python
Open-source technologies like Node.js, PostgreSQL, Turborepo, Lodash, and Zod
Industry-standard build tooling, including GitHub Actions, Terraform, and Spacelift
What We Value
An infinite learner. Someone who is relentless in their curiosity.
A customer obsessive. Someone who deeply care about delighting customers and solving real pains, not vanity metrics.
A winning attitude. You thrive with extreme accountability, learning as a team, and both giving and receiving rapid feedback.
Extreme empathy. Our customers are not tech companies. They live and work in the real world. Empathy is critical to arriving at correct solutions.
Unafraid of failure. You take risks. You see failure as an opportunity to learn, grow, and be better the next time. In a weird way, you trick your brain into being excited when you fail, because it means you got a new opportunity to learn more.
What We Require
Strong coding skills with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages, such as Javascript, C++, Python, Rust, or similar languages.
Strong engineering prowess, ideally developed at start-ups.
Familiarity with storage and data processing systems, cloud infrastructure, and other technical tools.
Strong written and verbal communication skills and ability to iterate quickly with teammates, incorporating feedback and holding a high bar for quality.
Don’t Work Here
Please Don't Join If You're Not Excited About
Building an AI product for an industry untouched by modern software
Constantly talking to and visiting customers in the field
Working ~70 hrs/week in person with some of the most ambitious people in NYC

Compensation
The estimated salary range for this position is $200,000 - $300,000/year.
Successful candidates with competing offers will receive matching and competitive offers.
Total compensation for this position may also include Incentive Stock Options, sign-on bonus, and other potential future incentives. This estimate excludes the value of any potential sign-on bonus; the value of any benefits offered; and the potential future value of any long-term incentives.
