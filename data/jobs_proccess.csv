This role offers the chance to help shape a new category of enterprise software focused on organizational intelligence and digital twin technology. You will work on a platform that connects data across complex ecosystems, transforms it into meaningful insight, and supports leaders as they make critical decisions at scale.
The product addresses a challenge that every growing organization faces. Knowledge fades when teams change, leaders divide their attention, or operations scale quickly. This platform preserves institutional memory, execution patterns, and decision context, combining personalization with strong privacy and trust requirements expected in modern enterprise environments.
The Role
You will join a small, highly capable engineering team and play a central role in building core product experiences. This position is hands on and product focused, with most of your time spent crafting intuitive, high performance user interfaces and the remainder dedicated to the backend systems that power them. The work emphasizes thoughtful design, speed, and scalability from the start.
What You Will Build
Design and develop clean, scalable APIs that connect user facing applications to backend services.
Create fast, accessible, and responsive web applications using Next.js as the primary framework.
Ensure excellent performance across devices and browsers, with careful attention to usability and accessibility.
Continuously improve system reliability, scalability, and maintainability while supporting rapid product iteration.
Partner closely with product, design, and research teams to translate ideas into polished features.
Identify and resolve issues across the stack, from frontend rendering and state management to backend integration and deployment.
Participate actively in code reviews and architectural discussions, helping define standards and best practices.
Take concepts from early prototypes through production release, contributing to true zero to one product development.
What You Bring
At least three years of professional experience as a full stack or frontend focused engineer.
A strong technical foundation through formal education or equivalent real world experience.
Deep hands on experience with Next.js and modern React based development.
Proficiency with TypeScript and modern styling approaches or CSS frameworks.
Practical backend experience, including API development, database interaction, and issue resolution.
A solid understanding of performance optimization and scalability in web applications.
Experience working in early stage environments or contributing to new product launches.
A self directed approach, comfortable making decisions, owning outcomes, and iterating with limited information.
Clear communication skills and a collaborative mindset.
This position is ideal for an engineer who enjoys building foundational systems, shaping user experiences, and contributing directly to the growth of an ambitious AI driven enterprise platform.
